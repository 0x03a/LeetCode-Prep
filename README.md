#  LeetCode Practice – Stay Consistent, Stay Sharp

Welcome to my **LeetCode Practice Repository**!

This repo is all about staying **consistent** with problem-solving and growing stronger in **data structures and algorithms**. I've divided the problems into two categories:

- **Important (imp)** – Must-solve, frequently asked in interviews  
- **Normal (normal)** – For daily practice and confidence-building

##  My Goal

This repository is my personal journey to stay consistent with LeetCode. If you're someone trying to improve daily, I hope this inspires you to:

 Practice every day  
 Focus on making a road map and practice every DSA topic after atleast 15-20 Days. 
 Build a strong foundation for coding interviews  
 Work on full-stack projects alongside.
