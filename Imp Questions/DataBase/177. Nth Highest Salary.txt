-- this query of mine is wrong a rank built in function of MYSQL will be used which will assign 
-- unique rank (numbers) to row values like if there are amount 100 200 200 400 it will assign 1 to 100 and 2 to both 200 bcz it is
-- assigning based on rank and 4 to 100 (1 gap, and this is the issue of rank)
-- it's syntax is rank over(ORDER BY colname ASC|DESC) 
-- In our scenario we have to avoid gaps so we will use DENSE_RANK this is same as but don't place a gap btw records
-- like ex
-- unique rank (numbers) to row values like if there are amount 100 200 200 400 it will assign 1 to 100 and 2 to both 200 bcz it is
-- assigning based on rank and 3 to 100 (no gap)

-- Every day data Science approach not mine.
